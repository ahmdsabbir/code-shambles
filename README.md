# Collapsit: Master the Art of Collapsing (and Un-Collapsing)

## Features
- Collapse/Uncollapse **all top-level functions and class methods** on a page.
- Future surprises... because who doesnâ€™t love an upgrade?

## Usage
Use commands with `ctrl+shift+P` or keyboard shortcuts.

# Commands
- Collapse all top level functions: `collapse: c: top-level`

# Keybindings
- Collapse all top level functions: `ctrl+alt+n`
- Un-collapse all top level functions: `ctrl+alt+m`

None... yet. But patience is a virtue, and settings are on the horizon.

## Known Issues
What issues? It's flawless.
